# Opera Google Search result blocking extension

This has similar functionality to Google Chrome's *Personal Blocklist* extension.

However, it does not currently sync with google.

Features:
* Allows you to block google search results based on hostnames & simple wildcards.
  - `*.example.com` wildcard format
* Allows you to remove google search redirects (optional).

Available here: [https://addons.opera.com/en/addons/extensions/details/google-search-results-blocker?display=en](https://addons.opera.com/en/addons/extensions/details/google-search-results-blocker?display=en)
or download in the downloads section.

To create an installable extension package, simply put all files in a zip, and change the extension to .oex .
